# Session

A session library that ?

Original issue https://github.com/at15/bform/issues/15

TODO:

- jwt or server storage or both

Planning to use https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server

Based on the graph in http://oauth2.thephpleague.com/authorization-server/which-grant/
Bform will use [Password Grant](http://oauth2.thephpleague.com/authorization-server/resource-owner-password-credentials-grant/)
since all the clients are first party clients.


TODO: why the client still need ID and secret? ....
